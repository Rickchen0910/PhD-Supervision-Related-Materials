###Hobijn and Frances 2000: 
An example of convergence groups as was mentioned. Here belonging to a group is connected to a stationarity test. We donâ€™t have to examine non-stationary examples as we can talk about groups of stationary series, at least in the beginning.
 
###Okui Wang 2018: 
Common breaks within units. The first paper examining breaks which do not affect all of the panel units.
 
###Oka Perron 2018: 
Excellent paper on how a break may affect only one of the equations. Has not been done for panel systems of equations.
 
###Smith 2018:  
Very close to what we talked about in the meeting. The paper is too general and therefore Baysian-Lasso type. If you can create a hypothesis test for a simplified version that could be great.
 
###Bonhomme Manresa 2015: 
The basic paper on panel group structure.
 
##Greenaway-McGrevy 2019: 
A panel forecasting paper.
